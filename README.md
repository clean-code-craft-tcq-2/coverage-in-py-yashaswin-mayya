# Prove and Cover the code

This project uses the
[unittest framework](https://docs.python.org/3/library/unittest.html)
to test functionality.

## The task

Code coverage is low. Expand the tests to take care of the variations. Track and improve the coverage.

Hint: Test the abstractions, instead of just end-to-end tests.

Uncovered lines indicate an opportunity to write tests.

> Caution: High coverage doesn't indicate no bugs!
